# test push

#1. Store a message in a variable, then print that message. 
my_name = "anthony"
print(my_name)

#2. Store a message in a variable, and print that message. Then change the value of your variable to a new message, and print the new message.
my_name = "anthony france"
print(my_name)

#3. Store a person’s name in a variable, and print a message to that person. 


#4. Store a person’s name in a variable, and then print that person’s name in lowercase, uppercase, and titlecase.
print(my_name.lower(), my_name.upper(), my_name.title())

#5. Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8.
# Be sure to enclose your operations in print statements to see the results.
print(1+7, 9-1, 2*4,16/2)

#6. Store your favorite number in a variable. Then, using that variable, create a message that reveals your favorite number. Print that message.
my_fav_number = 3
print(f"my favourite number is {my_fav_number}".title())


## Stretch and Challenge 
#1. Use an f-string to print out a message with a variable. 

#2. Use multiple variables in one string to print a message.
my_firstname = "Anthony"
my_surname = 'France'
print(f"My name is {my_firstname} {my_surname}")

#3. Set three variables, one that says, “Good”, another that says, “Day”, and another that says your name. “Add” them together, with a space between each word, and store it into another variable. Then, print out that variable. 
greet_good = "Good"
greet_day = "Day"
print(f"{greet_good} {greet_day} {my_firstname}")
